# Coding Problems

This repository holds the Problems (which are hard; atleast for me) and Solutions in TypeScript.

**<span style="color: #F32013;">CAUTION</span> I will be using [Deno](https://www.deno.land).**

## Folder Structure

```bash
|-- {problem_id}
    |-- Solution.ts
    |-- Solution.test.ts
|-- {problem_id}
    |-- Solution.ts
    |-- Solution.test.ts
```

## Problems

**Note: Starred problems are not finished yet (maybe not even started).**
